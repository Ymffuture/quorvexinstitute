## How to Rename a Downloaded File

When you download a file from **[FamaCloud](https://famacloud.vercel.app/files)**, it may appear without the correct file extension.  
For example, you might see the file saved as:

```

myselfpdf

```

However, for your computer or browser to open it correctly, it should be renamed with the proper **`.pdf`** extension:

```

myself.pdf

````

**Steps to Rename the File:**

1. Locate the file you downloaded on your device.
2. **Right-click** (or long-press on mobile) the file name.
3. Select **Rename**.
4. Add a dot (`.`) followed by the file extension:
   - Change `myselfpdf` â†’ `myself.pdf`
5. Press **Enter** (or tap **Done** on mobile) to save the new name.
6. Double-click (or tap) to open the PDF.

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Always make sure you know the correct file type before renaming. For PDFs, use `.pdf`; for images, `.jpg` or `.png`, etc.

## Code Examples with switch

Here a custom tab component from shadcn ui is used.
```jsx {7} showLineNumbers
<Tabs defaultValue="js" className="pt-5 pb-1">
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value="js">layout.jsx</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="ts">layout.tsx</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>

  <TabsContent value="js">

import ThemeProvider from './theme-provider'
 ```
```jsx showLineNumbers
export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body className="container">
        <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  )}
````

  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="ts">

```tsx {11} showLineNumbers
import ThemeProvider from './theme-provider'

export default function RootLayout({
children,
