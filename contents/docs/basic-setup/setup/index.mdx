Setting up your new documentation project is straightforward. Most of the essential project settings can be configured within the `settings` folder.

## Settings

This section provides the core settings for your documentation site, such as defining the site's URL, site icon and title.

```jsx showLineNumbers
export const url = "https://quorvexinstitute.vercel.app"   // The URL for your documentation site
export const siteicon = "/favicon.ico"                      // Icon displayed next to the site name in the header
export const sitename = "Quorvex Institute"                 // Title of your documentation site
````

## Google Tags

This section allows you to integrate Google Tag Manager into your documentation project. You can add your GTM code and configure whether it's connected.

```jsx showLineNumbers
export const gtm = "GTM-XXXXXXX"         // Add your Google Tag Manager code here
export const gtmconnected = true          // Set to true if GTM is connected, otherwise set to false
```

## Search Engine

Configure essential SEO settings to ensure your documentation site is optimized for search engines. This includes meta descriptions, keywords and social media sharing details like images and alt text.

```jsx showLineNumbers
export const description = "Quorvex Institute provides top-tier software development and AI integration training with modern web technologies."
export const keywords = ["Quorvex", "Software Development", "React.js", "Next.js", "TailwindCSS", "AI", "Coding"]
export const urlimage = "https://quorvexinstitute.vercel.app/images/quorvex-banner.png"  // Social sharing image URL
export const imagealt = "Quorvex Institute Banner"            // Alt text for shared images, helpful for screen readers
export const twitterhandle = "@quorvexinstitute"              // Your companyâ€™s Twitter handle for social sharing
```

## Footer Branding

The footer settings allow you to customize the company information displayed at the bottom of the site. You can add the company name and the URL that the name will link to.

```jsx showLineNumbers
export const companyname = "Quorvex Institute"                // The company name displayed in the copyright section
export const companylink = "https://quorvexinstitute.vercel.app"  // The URL your company name should link to
```

## General Layout

The layout settings control the appearance and functionality of various elements of the documentation site, such as branding, the right sidebar, feedback options, table of contents, and scroll-to-top functionality.

```jsx showLineNumbers
export const branding = true          // Set to true to display our branding elements
export const rightsidebar = true      // Set to true to enable the right sidebar with feedback, table of contents and scroll-to-top
export const feedbackedit = true      // Control to enable/disable feedback on GitHub
export const tableofcontent = true    // Control to enable/disable the generated table of contents
export const totopscroll = true       // Control to enable/disable scroll-to-top button
```

## Github Control

If your MDX files are hosted on GitHub, you can configure the project to load documents directly from there. This option can be useful for syncing documentation updates directly with your repository.

```jsx showLineNumbers
export const loadfromgithub = false   // Set to true to load your MDX documents directly from GitHub
```
