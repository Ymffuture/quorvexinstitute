## Basic Algebra

The area of a circle ($$A$$) can be calculated using the radius ($$r$$) as follows:

```math
A = \pi r^2
````

## Quadratic Formula

The quadratic formula for solving an equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is:

```math
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
```

## Newton's Second Law of Motion

Newton's second law of motion states that force ($F$) is the product of mass ($m$) and acceleration ($a$):

```math
F = ma
```

## Pythagorean Theorem

The Pythagorean theorem relates the lengths of the sides of a right triangle:

```math
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
```

## Einstein's Mass-Energy Equivalence

Einstein's famous equation relates energy ($E$), mass ($m$), and the speed of light ($c$):

```math
E = mc^2
```

## Additional Math Concepts

### Derivative Definition

The derivative of a function $f(x)$ at a point $x$ is defined as:

```math
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
```

### Integral of a Function

The definite integral of $f(x)$ from $a$ to $b$ is:

```math
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx
```

### Euler's Formula

Eulerâ€™s formula relates complex exponentials to trigonometric functions:

```math
e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta
```

### Binomial Theorem

For any positive integer $n$, the expansion of $(x + y)^n$ is:

```math
(x + y)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} x^{n-k} y^k
```

### Law of Sines

In any triangle, the law of sines relates side lengths to angles:

```math
\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C}
```
